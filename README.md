Batch Activation Utility
========================

This is a simple utility that allows for the snapshotting and activation of all flows in a given tenant.

## Usage

A valid Tenant ID and authorization token for a Builder user are needed to run the tool - documentation for finding these is available [here](https://developers.manywho.com/display/MA/Authenticating+Builder+Users).

Simply enter the required information, then click the **Activate all flows** button!
